/***
 * Tabs are convenient for organizing related functions
 * The main tab is the tab with the name of the sketch
 * In this case, twoMotorIntro is the main tab
 * 
 * Only one thing to remember about tabs
 * The side tabs use somewhat independent
 * Variables used in the main tab must be declared inside the main tab
 * Variables from the main tab can be used in side tabs
 * BUT variables declared in side tabs exists only in that side tab
 * Variables used in the main tab
 * 
 * If I declared a variable in this side tab, 
 * it would be a 'local' variable because it can 
 * only be used locally, in this tab
 * 
 * If I declared a variable in the main tab, 
 * it would be a 'global' variable because it can
 * be used by any other tabs or functions
